# SideBall
This is my first big solo project - a game in Unity! I built this project near the end of my first year out of a desire to release an app on Google Play. I hope you enjoy it!

## Rules
The Ball moves on its own, all you do is control its speed by tapping or tapping and holding. Avoid the spinning shurikens, collect coins, and survive for as long as possible!

## Refactoring
It has been more than a year since I last worked on this project, and my programming skills have greatly improved! I will be constantly refactoring this project with new skills and techniques that I have learned. 

## APK Download
Unfortunately, SideBall has been removed from Google Play following my Google Play Console account termination, so until I can figure out what happened, I provided an .apk named SideBallv0.4.apk that you can use to download the app.
